### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kelly Nelson and I am a software engineer.  I am currently attending a Bootcamp through General Assembly where I am learning how to code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Python.  Before this, I did about 6 months of self-study as I made my transition from the field of nutrition to TECH.  I'm confident that my 11 years of experience as a nutritionist have primed me to be an excellent software engineer as I was solving problems for my clients daily.  These problem solving skills are helping me in this new field immensely. As you can imagine, I am learning something new everyday and am excited to continue this journey.

### When I'm not coding . . .
I love to travel to new places around the world and hike or mountain bike whenever possible.  I recently went to Switzerland and spent 5 days hiking all over Zermatt.  At home I love to explore local restuarants and craft cocktail bars, or relax at home and play strategy card games.
