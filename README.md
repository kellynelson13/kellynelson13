### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kelly Nelson and I am a software engineer.  I am currently attending a Bootcamp through General Assembly where I am learning how to code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, EJS, Mongoose, React, and Python.  Before this, I did about 6 months of self-study, including Codecademy's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Intermediate JavaScript, and React courses.  I also watched and learned from many Youtube tutorials and Free Code Camp challenges.  Prior to this, I spent 11 years as a nutritionist where I was the head nutrition practitioner, clinic manager, and lead instructor at my company.  Several years into this, I built my own practice.  All of this experience primed me to be an excellent software engineer as this taught me problem-solving skills and how to manage multiple tasks at the same time.  As you can imagine, I am learning something new everyday and am excited to continue this journey.

### When I'm not coding . . .
I love to travel to new places around the world and hike or mountain bike whenever possible.  I recently went to Switzerland and spent 5 days hiking all over Zermatt.  At home I love to explore local restuarants and craft cocktail bars, or relax at home and play strategy card games.
