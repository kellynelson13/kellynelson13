### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kelly Nelson and I am a software engineer.  I am currently attending a Bootcamp through General Assembly where I am learning how to code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, EJS, Mongoose, React, and Python.  Before this, I did about 6 months of self-study, including Codecademy's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Intermediate JavaScript, and React courses.  I definitely went down some deep Youtube rabbit holes getting excited about React and all things front-end!  As you can imagine, I am learning something new everyday and am excited to continue this journey.

### Prior to changing careers into tech . . . 
I spent 11 years as a nutritionist where I was the head nutrition practitioner, clinic manager, and lead instructor at my company.  Several years into this, I built my own practice where I saw 4-5 clients a day while continuing to run things at the clinic I still worked at. [Here](https://www.nourishedbrain.com/) is my website for my practice where you can read testimonials from previous clients. All of this experience primed me to be an excellent software engineer as it taught me how to manage and prioritize my many daily tasks while actively assessing my clients' health needs and coming up with action plans each time we would meet.   

### When I'm not coding . . .
I love to travel to new places around the world and hike or mountain bike whenever possible.  I recently went to Switzerland and spent 5 days hiking all over Zermatt.  At home I love to explore local restuarants and craft cocktail bars, or relax at home and play strategy card games.
